# Interactive-3D-Graphics-Engine-with-Lambertian-and-Blinn-Phong-Reflectance
Developed for MATH 214 at UofMichigan; project demonstrates computer graphics concepts using Lambertian and Blinn-Phong reflectance models. The 3D engine uses OpenGL, GLFW, and PyOpenGL for realistic rendering. Key concepts include shading algorithms, matrix transformations, and vector math, with support for flat, Gouraud, and Phong shading.
